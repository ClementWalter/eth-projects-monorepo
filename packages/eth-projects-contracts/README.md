# Contracts

This package contains miscellaneous contracts and libraries used for especially, but not only, for on-chain NFT projects.

Because libraries use `public` only functions, it's not necessary to redeploy them. You can find in the `deployments` folder
the corresponding addresses on different networks.

By doing so, you will save gas for yourself, block space for everyone and eventually globally increase the average
quality of the code bases in ethereum: using a common libraries incentives the users to make pull request to the
original code base instead of copy/pasting and making local changes.

The current total amount of saved gas is: **4,041,118**.
